Creating a checklist for your Messages App Extension AI to tailor texts appropriately based on the recipient and situation is a thoughtful approach. While a comprehensive checklist may not be readily available in a single source, you can develop one by combining insights from various domains like communication theory, business etiquette, and interpersonal relationship management. Here's a suggested checklist that the AI could use to understand the context and tailor the message accordingly:

1. **Relationship with the Recipient**:
   - What is your relationship with the recipient (e.g., friend, family, colleague, superior, client)?
   - How formal or informal is your usual communication with this person?

2. **Purpose of the Message**:
   - What is the primary purpose of your message (e.g., to inform, request, persuade, apologize, thank)?
   - Is there a specific action or response you expect from the recipient?

3. **Tone and Formality**:
   - What tone is appropriate for this message (e.g., friendly, formal, casual, professional)?
   - Are there any cultural or situational sensitivities to consider in the tone?

4. **Content Sensitivity**:
   - Does the message contain sensitive or confidential information?
   - Are there aspects of the message that could be misunderstood or misinterpreted?

5. **Urgency and Timing**:
   - Is there a deadline or a sense of urgency associated with the message?
   - Is this an appropriate time to send the message considering the recipient's time zone or likely schedule?

6. **Length and Clarity**:
   - Should the message be brief and to the point, or is a detailed explanation required?
   - Is clarity or brevity more important for this particular message?

7. **Emotional Considerations**:
   - Are there any emotional aspects to consider (e.g., is the recipient going through a tough time)?
   - How might the recipient's current emotional state affect how they receive the message?

8. **Previous Communications**:
   - Are there previous communications on this topic that should be referenced or acknowledged?
   - Is this message a continuation of an ongoing conversation or a new topic?

9. **Language and Style Preferences**:
   - Does the recipient prefer certain styles of communication (e.g., straightforward, detailed, humorous)?
   - Are there specific phrases or terms that should be used or avoided?

10. **Feedback and Clarification**:
    - How open is the recipient to feedback or questions in case clarification is needed?
    - Is there a preferred method for the recipient to respond or give feedback?

By integrating these questions, your AI can more effectively tailor messages to suit the specific context and relationship dynamics. This checklist can be refined further based on user feedback and AI learning over time.c
